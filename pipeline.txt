#data injection
connstant file ->confiuration file ->data injection

->we are creating varibales for constant file
->after creating constant file we are using varibales created in constant file in configuration file
for configuration of file like which has to store in which location
->and in data injection file we are reading data from configuration output file and injecting 
the data into Artifacts folder and sub foleders

#data transormation
connstant file ->confiuration file ->feature engineering
-> agin we are going to define feature engineering varibales
1.we are trying create two folders in Artifacts folders named Data transformation & preprocessor
2.in data transoformation folder again one folder named Transformation with  transformed_train.csv & transformed_test.csv
3.And in preprocessor folder preprocessor.pkl,feature engineering.pkl files
-> and connect with configuration flie 
-> and perform feature engineering if  require we will create a helper code in utils.py
